          <p>Alluri Sitarama Raju (4 July 1897 or 1898 – 7 May 1924) was an Indian revolutionary who waged an armed campaign against the British colonial rule in India. Born in present-day Andhra Pradesh, he was involved in opposing the British in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act that effectively restricted the free movement of adivasis in their forest habitats and prevented them from practicing their traditional form of agriculture called 'podu', which threatened their very way of life. Rise in discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the Non-cooperation movement (1920-1922) led to the Rampa rebellion (1922-1924) in which Alluri Sitarama Raju played the major role as its leader. Mustering combined forces of tribals and other sympathizers to the cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British forces across the border regions of present-day Andhra Pradesh and Odisha states in India.[a] He was given the title "Manyam Veerudu" (transl. Hero of the Jungle) by the local people for his heroic exploits.

          Born into a Telugu speaking family as Alluri Rama Raju, he prefixed the name "Sita" to his in memory of a girl whom he loved during his youth and whose untimely demise at a young age left him heartbroken. He later took up sannyasa at the age of 18 and grew to become a charismatic leader of the downtrodden tribal people in the 20th century colonial India. As the leader of the Manyam rebellion or the Rampa Rebellion of 1922, Alluri Sitarama Raju led his forces against the British colonial rulers with an aim of expelling them from the Eastern Ghats region in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. During the rebellion he led numerous raids on the imperial police stations to acquire firearms for his under-equipped forces. After each raid, he would leave a written note in the station signed by him informing the police about the details of his plunder there including details of the weaponry he acquired and dare them to stop him if they can.
          Police stations in and around areas of Annavaram, Addateegala, Chintapalle, Dammanapalli, Krishna Devi Peta, Rampachodavaram, Rajavommangi, and Narsipatnam were all targeted by his forces, which resulted in significant police casualties. In response to these raids and to quell the rebellion, the British colonial authorities undertook a nearly two-year long manhunt for Alluri Sitarama Raju that resulted in expenditures reaching over ₹4 million rupees then. Eventually in 1924, he was trapped at Koyyuru village in Chintapalle forests. There, he was captured, tied to a tree, and was summarily executed by a firing squad. A mausoleum with his final remains was built in the village of Krishnadevipeta in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
          <h1>Birth and childhood</h1>

    <p>Alluri Sitarama Raju was born into a Telugu speaking family in the current state of Andhra Pradesh, India. His father, Venkata Rama Raju, was a professional photographer who settled in the town of Rajahmundry for his vocation. His mother, Surya Narayanamma, was a pious homemaker.His date of birth is disputed with some sources reporting it as 4 July 1897 and others as 4 July 1898. Details of his place of birth also vary, an official report suggests he was born in Bhimavaram,while several other sources cite it to be the village of Mogallu in West Godavari District.New reports suggest that the village of Pandrangi in Bheemunipatnam is his precise place of birth.Venkata Rama Raju was a free spirited man with immense self respect and great love for freedom. He once chided a young Rama Raju for practicing the then prevalent custom of Indian people saluting the Europeans in acknowledgement of their superiority. Venkata Rama Raju died when his son was aged 8.</p>
          
          <h2>Education and youth</h2></header>
      
    <p>Rama Raju completed his primary education and joined High school in Kakinada where he became a friend of Madduri Annapurnaiah (1899–1954) who later grew up to be another prominent Indian revolutionary. In his teens, Rama Raju in accordance with his reticent and meditative nature contemplated taking Sannyasa. At the age of 15, he moved to his mother's home town of Visakhapatnam to pursue high school and university education. There he was enrolled at Mrs. A.V.N. College for the fourth form exam. While there, oftentimes he visited far flung areas in the Visakhapatnam district and made himself familiar with the struggles of the tribal people over there.
    Around this time, he became a friend of a rich man and developed platonic love for his friend's sister named Sita, whose untimely demise at a young age left him heartbroken. To make her memory eternal, Rama Raju then prefixed her name to his and came to be popularly known as Sita Rama Raju.[3] He eventually dropped out from schooling without completing his course. At this instance his uncle Rama Krishnam Raju who was a tehsildar in Narsapur of the West Godavari district, and under whose tutelage Rama raju grew up so far, brought him to Narasapur and admitted him in the local Taylor High School. He however later gave up formal education but privately mastered the literature of Telugu, Sanskrit, Hindi, and English languages. Contemporary reports indicate that although he had an undistinguished education, he took a particular interest in astrology, herbal medicine, palmistry, and equestrianism, before becoming a sannyasi (religious ascetic) at the age of 18.</p>
